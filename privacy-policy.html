            <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit</li>
            <li>The time spent on those pages</li>
            <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information processed and maintained.</p>

        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
